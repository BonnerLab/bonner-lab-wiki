Please refer to [this document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U8TEeftGsMxxubA7ezkoN2EPhBC5VkNR/view?usp=sharing) for information about getting started scanning at Kennedy Krieger.

Look [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gyOLBsDv_35Bpvjsaa-pSOpPRlPxOBgV/view?usp=sharing) for a map of the JHMI campus.

Look here for a template scan plan. (coming soon!)

Also, [here](https://fischerlab.johnshopkins.edu/Li/HowToOperateMR1@KKI/ScannerOperationStepByStep.html) is a useful overview of how to use the MRI computer, scanner, button box, etc. written by Li Guo from Jason Fischerâ€™s lab. (Some of the images may be a bit outdated, but the MRI system still mostly looks/works the same.)
